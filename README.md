# Advent of Code 2020

My solution for Advent of Code 2020. They are written in Go as a learning exercise.

## Running Solutions

You can run these solutions in an environment that has Go installed.

To run a solution, you can use the provided `run-solution` script, along with the day you wish to run. e.g.
```
./run-solution day1
```

You can also provide additional arguments to the command to run each part of each days solution, like so:
```
./run-solution day1 part1
```

## Setup a New Day

To make it easy to set up boilerplate code for a new day, templates and a script have been provided to configure a new day automaticaly. To do this, just run the `setup-day` script and provide the day you wish to configure. e.g.

```
./setup-day day1
```
